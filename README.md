This is a test automation framework to test GitSearch API. I am only using GET for this practice, however, I have also setup for POST in the utilities. You should be able to add PUT and DELETE in the same manner, if there is a need. You can use the framework to test any other Rest/Restful by modifying the baseURI, path,endpoints, and query parameters.
